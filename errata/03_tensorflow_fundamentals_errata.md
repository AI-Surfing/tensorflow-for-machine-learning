# Errata - Chapter 3: TensorFlow Fundamentals

This chapter was included in a sample release of the book, so we include the page number for the sample in parentheses:

**Full book page no. (sample chapters page no.)

* **p.57: (p.19)** "...the function automatically converts the scalar numbers 6 and 3 into `Tensor` objects...". The number "6" should be "5" - _Found 7/21/2016_

* **p.65 (p.27:**) "d = tf.add(c,d, name='add_d')". The `c,d` parameters should be `b,c` in this case. - _Found 7/21/2016_
